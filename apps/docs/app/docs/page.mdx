# Introduction

Welcome to **r.ui** — a collection of beautifully designed, accessible components for React Native.

## What is r.ui?

r.ui is a component library that provides building blocks for React Native applications. Like shadcn/ui for the web, r.ui components are designed to be copied into your project — you own the code, with no hidden dependencies.

## Key Features

- **Universal** — Works on iOS, Android, and Web via React Native Web
- **Accessible** — Built with accessibility in mind from the ground up
- **Themeable** — Dark, light, and oatmeal themes out of the box
- **TypeScript** — Full TypeScript support with exported types
- **NativeWind** — Styled with Tailwind CSS via NativeWind
- **Copy & Paste** — Own your code, customize freely

## Quick Start

Install a component using the CLI:

```bash
npx r-ui add button
```

Then use it in your app:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Button variant="primary" onPress={() => console.log('Pressed!')}>
      Get Started
    </Button>
  )
}
```
