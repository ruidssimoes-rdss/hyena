### Does Hyena support Expo?

Yes! Hyena works with Expo out of the box. No additional configuration required.

### Can I use Hyena with web-only React?

Hyena is built for React Native and React Native Web. For web-only React projects, consider using shadcn/ui or Radix UI directly.

### How do I use Hyena with TypeScript?

Hyena is written in TypeScript and includes full type definitions. No additional `@types` packages needed.

```tsx
import { Button, ButtonProps } from '@hyena-studio/react-native'

// Full autocomplete and type checking
const MyButton: React.FC<ButtonProps> = (props) => (
  <Button variant="primary" {...props} />
)
```

### What's the bundle size?

Hyena is tree-shakeable. You only pay for what you import:

```tsx
// Only Button code is included
import { Button } from '@hyena-studio/react-native'
```

Individual component sizes vary from 1-5KB minified+gzipped.
